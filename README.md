Curated self-nomination calls for reviewers and committee members of
CCF- and CORE-ranked conferences.

**[Browse the live website &rarr;](https://ZhongkuiMa.github.io/ReviewerCalls/)**

## What This Is

ReviewerCalls aggregates publicly available reviewer self-nomination pages from 321 CCF- and CORE-ranked computer science conferences. If a conference is accepting volunteer reviewers, program committee members, or artifact evaluation committee members, we aim to list it here.

Automated discovery runs weekly. Each candidate is manually verified before appearing on the website.

## How It Works

1. **Discovery** -- An automated system searches conference websites for reviewer nomination pages weekly
2. **Verification** -- Each candidate is manually reviewed to confirm it is a genuine self-nomination page
3. **Publication** -- Verified entries appear on the website, updated automatically

## What Qualifies

A page qualifies only if it explicitly invites individuals to apply or nominate themselves for:
- Reviewer / External Reviewer
- Program Committee (PC) / Senior Program Committee (SPC)
- Area Chair (AC) / Senior Area Chair (SAC)
- Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC)
- Emergency Reviewer

Out of scope: invitation-only calls, chair-nominated processes, private or login-required pages.
